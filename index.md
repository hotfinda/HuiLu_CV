# Projects & Experience

### Intelligent robot lab in Northwestern Polytechnical University（2020.3-）
**Semantic SLAM based on binocular vision**  
Utilizing the semantic information of objects to establish a labeled environment map to realize the functions of object detection and classification, tracking navigation, and rapid robot positioning.
- **Semantic segmentation based on deep learning**, aims to classify objects in 2D images and provide semantic pixels for control system.
- **Semantic mapping**, combining 2D semantic information with 3D construction for environment, proving point cloud data for navigation and position.
- Robustness test and noise analyse, calculating the accuaracy of algorithm under multiple noise effect, and reducing the noise effect through post-processing.

### Autonomus lab in Politecnico di Milano（2019.9-2020.3）
**Teinvein self-driving project**  
Development of self-driving car with functions of remote operation control, automatic GPS navigation and positioning, lane line tracking navigation, and obstacle detection, funded by STMicroelectronics Company.
- **Multiple lane line detecting**, providing lane line pixels coordinate information for control system based on deep learning methods, complicated situation such as lane line departure, fading lane lines are concluded.
- **Obstacle detection**, images captured by binocular camera are processed through Yolo3 network, and related coordinate information is tranfered to control system.
- **Robustness test and noise analyse**, noise effect in images like raindrops, shadows, glare are reduced through post-processing.
- Based on ROS , realize data transfer, system feedback and information exchange.

### INSTITUT FÜR STRUKTURMECHANIK UND LEICHTBAU in RWTH-Aachen (2017.9-2018.5) 
**Lightweighting Design**  
Study the influence of distribution pattern of graphene plate on the structural strength.

### Intelligent robot lab in Northwestern Polytechnical University (2016.9-2017.2) 
**Dynamic and static load test**  
Design the pattern of sensors distribution on robot and guarantee the accurate test of dynamic and static load.
