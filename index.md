# Projects & Experience

### Intelligent robot lab in Northwestern Polytechnical University（2020.3-）
**Drone intelligent navigation project**  
Collecting the semantic information of surroudings to establish a semantic map to make drone fly safely and resilient。
- **Semantic segmentation based on deep learning**, aims to classify objects in 2D images captured by drones and provide semantic pixels for the visual system.
- **Semantic map construction**, combining semantic pixels and 3D construction for environment, providing coordinate and semantic information for navigation
- Exchange with drone control system, utilizing the feedback from drone control system, adjust the drones in realtime.
- Robustness test and noise analyse, testing the reliablity of system under multiple noise effect, and reducing the noise effect through post-processing.

### Autonomus lab in Politecnico di Milano（2019.9-2020.3）
**Teinvein self-driving project**  
Development of self-driving car with functions of remote operation control, automatic GPS navigation and positioning, lane line tracking navigation, and obstacle detection, funded by STMicroelectronics Company.
- **Multiple lane line detecting**, providing lane line pixels coordinate information for control system based on deep learning methods, complicated situation such as lane line departure, fading lane lines are concluded.
- **Obstacle detection**, images captured by binocular camera are processed through Yolo3 network, and related coordinate information is tranfered to control system.
- **Robustness test and noise analyse**, noise effect in images like raindrops, shadows, glare are reduced through post-processing.
- **System control Based on coordinate information**, utilizing the information in ROS topic, realize data transfer,system feedback and information exchange.

### INSTITUT FÜR STRUKTURMECHANIK UND LEICHTBAU in RWTH-Aachen (2017.9-2018.5)
